# Fun with Interaces, episode 2: Patterns

This repository is a collection of demos for the "Fun with Interfaces, episode 2: Patterns" live blog on http://vjeko.live/

This is what each branch is (or does):
* `demo-01`: Shows a typical business example of a tightly-bound functionality
* `demo-02`: Adds an additional type of dependency to introduce the necessity of even discussing dependency injection
* `demo-03`: Introduces interfaces. This branch compiles, but fails at runtime. It's purpose is merely to introduce the interfaces, not to implement them yet.
* `demo-04`: Uses enums to invert dependency control
* `demo-05`: Uses dependency injection to invert dependency control
* `demo-06`: Decoupling more dependencies using injection
* `demo-07`: Introducing factory pattern
* `demo-08`: Proposing discovery factory pattern
